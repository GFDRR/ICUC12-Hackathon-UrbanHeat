# Urban Heat Resilience Hackathon @ ICUC12

As part of the International Conference on Urban Climate ([ICUC12]([url](https://icuc12.eu/))), the World Bank-GFDRR team under the Global Program on Urban Heat Resilience and the City Resilience Program, [@matthiasdemuzere](https://github.com/matthiasdemuzere), hosted a hands-on hackathon focused on urban heat resilience. We designed a set of challenges across three spatial scales: city, neighborhood, and building, and provided curated datasets for Timbuktu (Mali) and Davao (Philippines).

Participants were invited to explore these datasets using starter code based on our own workflows. The goal: develop scalable and actionable tools to support climate adaptation and urban planning.

Whether it's identifying locally effective cooling interventions or helping a mayor make the case for heat shelters, this repository holds everything used in the hackathon:

🔧 Ready-to-run Python notebooks

📊 Open-source urban datasets (available via Zenodo)

🌍 Real-world challenge descriptions

📦 Tools for modeling, analysis & visualization

We hope this repo inspires further innovation in tackling urban heat stress—feel free to fork, adapt, and contribute!
